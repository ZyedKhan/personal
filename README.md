# 🌐 Enterprise Reusable Data Engineering Framework (POC → Org Adoption)

## 📌 Overview

Designed and developed a **Common Utilities Framework** aimed at reducing code redundancy and increasing reusability across enterprise data modules.

Originally developed as a POC, the framework was later adopted across multiple enterprise systems to standardize ingestion, validation, logging, and processing patterns.

### 🎯 Objective

- Eliminate repetitive ingestion logic
- Standardize data validation pipelines
- Centralize logging & metadata extraction
- Improve maintainability & modularity
- Accelerate onboarding of new pipelines
- Reduce development time across teams

---

## 🏗 Architecture Philosophy

The framework follows:

- Modular design
- Configuration-driven ingestion
- Source-agnostic connectors
- Extensible processing layers
- Centralized observability
- AI-assisted metadata enrichment

---

## 🔄 Multi-Source Ingestion Engine

Designed ingestion modules supporting:

- REST APIs (OAuth secured)
- Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL)
- File-based ingestion (CSV, JSON, XML)
- Cloud object storage (AWS S3)
- Streaming sources (Kafka)

Features:

- Schema validation
- Automatic retry handling
- Checkpointing
- Incremental & full load support
- Data integrity validation
- Bad data segregation

---

## ⚙ Airflow DAG Engineering

Owned and optimized enterprise Airflow DAGs:

- Modular DAG architecture
- Dynamic DAG generation
- Parameterized workflows
- Dependency graph optimization
- Failure recovery & retry strategies
- SLA monitoring
- Task-level logging enhancements

Improved orchestration stability and reduced operational overhead.

## 🧠 AI & Agentic Integration in Data Platform

Integrated AI-driven capabilities including:

### 1️⃣ ML-Based Metadata Extraction
- Automated dataset classification
- Intelligent schema inference
- Column-level metadata tagging
- Feature categorization for ML pipelines

### 2️⃣ Agentic AI for Logging & Documentation
- AI-driven automated logging enhancements
- Self-updating documentation systems
- Intelligent pipeline summaries
- Context-aware error interpretation

Bridged traditional data engineering with modern AI augmentation.
